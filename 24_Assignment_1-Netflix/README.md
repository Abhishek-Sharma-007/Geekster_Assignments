3. `<div id="netflix_image">`: This div with the "netflix_image" ID holds the Netflix logo, which is an image sourced from an external URL.
4. `<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Netflix_2015_logo.svg/2560px-Netflix_2015_logo.svg.png" width="148" height="50"/>`: This is an image element that displays the Netflix logo sourced from the provided URL and sets its width and height attributes.
5. `<div id="button">`: This div with the "button" ID contains the sign-in and register buttons.

**Explanation:**

3. `#top`: Styles the top section container by setting its height and displaying it as a flex container.
4. `#alpha`: Styles the main container by giving it a semi-transparent black background and setting its height to fill the viewport.
5. `#signin`: Styles the sign-in and register buttons by setting their background color, padding, border, font color, font size, border radius, and font weight.
6. `#button`: Styles the button container by adding padding, setting its width, and aligning the buttons to the right.
7. `h1`: Styles the main heading by setting its font size and margin.
8. `p`: Styles paragraphs by setting their margin and font weight.
9. `#p1`: Styles the first paragraph with the "p1" ID by setting its font size.
10. `#p2`: Styles the second paragraph with the "p2" ID by setting its font size.
11. `#mid`: Styles the middle section container by setting its text color, displaying it as a flex container, and vertically aligning its content.
