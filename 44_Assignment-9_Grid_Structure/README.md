## **EXPLANATION:**
1. In your HTML file (`index.html`):
   - You start with the usual HTML document structure with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
   - In the `<head>` section, you define the document's metadata, including the character set, viewport settings, and the title of your webpage.
   - You link an external stylesheet named "style.css" to your HTML file using the `<link>` element. This connects your HTML file to the CSS file for styling.
2. In your CSS file (`style.css`):
   - You begin by setting the `margin` property for the `body` element to 0%, which removes any default margins around the body content.
   - You define a CSS class called `.container`, which is applied to a `div` element in your HTML. This class sets up a grid layout with specific column and row properties.
   - Within the `.container` class, you use the `display: grid;` property to create a grid layout. This grid has 16 columns, each spanning 6.25% of the container's width, and 6 rows, each with a height of 6rem. The container itself has a fixed height of 36rem and a white border on a black background.
   - You define classes like `.g1`, `.g2`, `.g3`, and so on, to target specific grid items within the container. These classes are used to position and style individual grid items.
   - Each grid item has properties like `grid-area`, `grid-column`, and `grid-row` set to position them within the grid.
   - You define the `.nav` class within the `.g1` grid item to style a navigation bar inside it. This class sets up a flex container with evenly spaced buttons.
   - Buttons within the `.nav` class have specific styling, such as background color, text color, padding, and border radius.
   - The `.item` class is a general class for styling all grid items. It gives them a white background, a border, and some margin and padding.
