# Assignment 1 - Responsive Landing page (Tailwind)
---
## TASK 
- You need to complete **Responsive Landing Page** task, and we have learned basic CSS Properties like:
1. **Utility-first approach:** Tailwind CSS is designed around the utility-first approach, which means it provides a wide range of small, single-purpose utility classes that you can apply directly to your HTML elements. For example, you can add classes like `bg-blue-500` to set the background color to a shade of blue, or `text-xl` to set the font size to extra-large.
2. **Responsive design:** Tailwind CSS includes built-in responsive design classes that make it easy to create responsive UIs. You can apply classes like `md:w-1/2` to make an element take up half of the width on medium-sized screens. This eliminates the need for writing media queries in most cases, saving you time and effort.
3. **Flexibility:** Tailwind CSS is highly customizable. You can configure the framework to include only the utility classes you need, which can help keep your CSS file size minimal. You can also create custom utility classes and components tailored to your project.
4. **Speed:** One of the primary advantages of Tailwind CSS is speed. Since you're not writing custom CSS, you can prototype and build UIs much faster. The utility classes are predictable and easy to understand, making it straightforward to style elements consistently across your project.
5. **Consistency:** Tailwind CSS promotes consistency in design because it enforces a set of predefined styles and naming conventions. This helps ensure that your UI elements maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout your application.
6. **Reduced context switching:** With Tailwind CSS, you can stay focused on your HTML markup while applying styles, reducing the need to switch back and forth between HTML and CSS files. This can improve your workflow and productivity.
7. **Large community and ecosystem:** Tailwind CSS has a large and active community, which means you can find a wealth of resources, plugins, and third-party integrations to enhance your development process.
8. **CSS-in-JS support:** If you prefer a CSS-in-JS approach, Tailwind CSS also has official JavaScript plugins like `@headlessui/react` that allow you to use Tailwind CSS classes in a more JavaScript-oriented way.

## EXPLANATION:

1. **HTML Structure:**
    1. The document begins with the usual HTML5 doctype declaration.
    2. Inside the `<head>` section, there are meta tags for character set and viewport configuration. The page title is set to "tailwind," and an external CSS stylesheet named "style.css" is linked.
    3. The `<body>` section contains the content of the webpage.
    4. The `<header>` element represents the website's header section. It contains the site's logo (a green circle with a white icon), site name ("Geekster"), navigation links ("Home," "About Us," "Contact Us," "Map"), and a button with the text "Geek" and a dropdown icon.
    5. The `<section>` element represents the main content section of the webpage. It contains a container with two columns. The first column contains a title ("Before they sold out readymade gluten"), a paragraph of text, and two buttons ("Yes" and "No"). The second column contains an image.
       
2. **CSS Structure:**
    1. The CSS code begins with some global styling and resets. It sets the box-sizing to border-box, removes default border styles, and normalizes various styles for consistent rendering across browsers.
    2. It defines some default styles for HTML elements like headings, links, and form elements.
    3. Media queries for different screen sizes are included to make the page responsive. These media queries adjust the max-width of the container for different breakpoints, ensuring the content remains readable on various devices.
    4. Tailwind CSS classes are defined in the CSS code. These classes provide styles for various aspects of the HTML structure, such as margins (`m-10`, `mx-auto`), padding (`p-10`, `px-3`), text styles (`text-3xl`, `text-gray-600`), background colors (`bg-blue-500`, `bg-gray-100`), and more.
    5. There are also hover and focus styles defined, like `hover:bg-blue-600` for changing the background color on hover and `focus:outline-none` for removing outlines on focus.
    6. Media queries are used to define specific styles for different screen sizes, such as tablet (`@media (min-width: 768px)`) and large desktop (`@media (min-width: 1024px)`) sizes.
    7. The CSS code also defines custom CSS variables (prefixed with `--tw-`) that can be used to customize the styles easily.
