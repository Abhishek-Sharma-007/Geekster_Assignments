# Weekly Test 3 - CSS Properties
---
## TASK 
- You need to complete "Weekly Test 3" task, and we have learned basic CSS Properties like:
  1. **Margin:**
     Margins are the space outside the boundary of an element. They create space between elements or between an element and its parent's boundary. You can set margin values for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, left) to control the spacing.
  2. **Padding:**
     Padding is the space inside the boundary of an element. It creates space between the content of an element and its border. Similar to margins, you can set padding values for each side of an element.  
  3. **Box-Sizing:**
     The `box-sizing` property defines how the width and height of an element are calculated, including its padding and border. The two common values are:
     - `content-box`: The width and height only include the content, excluding padding and border.
     - `border-box`: The width and height include content, padding, and border.  
  4. **Linear Gradient:**
     A `linear-gradient` is a CSS function that creates a gradient effect along a straight line. It's often used as a background property. The gradient consists of color stops defined by specific colors and positions, transitioning from one color to another.
  5. **Color:**
     The `color` property sets the color of text content. It can take various forms, including color names, hexadecimal values, RGB values, and more.  
  6. **Text-Align:**
     The `text-align` property determines the horizontal alignment of text within an element. It can be used to align text to the left, right, center, or justify it.
  7. **Position:**
     The `position` property is used to control the positioning of elements within a document. It has several values:
     - `static` (default): Elements are positioned based on the normal flow of the document.
     - `relative`: Elements are positioned relative to their normal position.
     - `absolute`: Elements are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
     - `fixed`: Elements are positioned relative to the viewport and stay fixed even when scrolling.
     - `sticky`: Elements are positioned based on the user's scroll position.
  8. **Overflow:**
     The `overflow` property controls how content that overflows the boundaries of an element is displayed. It can have values like `visible`, `hidden`, `scroll`, or `auto`.
  9. **Font-Size:**
     The `font-size` property sets the size of the font within an element. It can be specified using various units such as pixels, ems, rems, percentages, etc.  
  10. **Line-Height:**
      The `line-height` property controls the vertical space between lines of text within an element. It can be used to improve readability and adjust the spacing between lines.
  11. **Box Shadow:**
      The `box-shadow` property adds a shadow effect to an element. It allows you to control the shadow's color, blur radius, spread distance, and position.  
  12. **Border Radius:**
      The `border-radius` property rounds the corners of an element, creating rounded edges. You can set the radius for each corner individually or use a single value for all corners.

## EXPLANATION:
1. **Top Section (`<div class="top">`):**
   - The `top` class in the CSS defines a gradient background, white text color, centered alignment, and padding. This creates an eye-catching header with a promotional message.
2. **Navigation Bar (`<nav class="navbar">`):**
   - The `navbar` class styles the navigation bar at the top of the page. It sets a black background, sticky position, white text color, and padding for spacing.
   - Inside this navigation bar, the `<h5>` elements represent navigation links for different categories, and they have a margin for spacing.
   - The input element and search icon are styled to form a search bar.
3. **Top Page Title (`<section class="top-page-title">`):**
   - The `top-page-title` class styles the top section of the page. It sets a background image, text color, and padding for spacing.
   - The header inside this section has a semi-transparent background for better readability of the title and description text.
4. **Mid Trending Section (`<section class="mid-trending">`):**
   - The `mid-trending` class gives padding and a light background color to the trending section.
   - The `mid-trend-content` class styles the container for the trending items. It gives a slightly darker background and margin for spacing.
   - Inside this container, each `mid-trending-image-box` class styles an individual item box with a set height, width, background color, and white text. This creates a grid-like display of images and captions.
5. **Bottom Section (`<section class="bottom">`):**
   - The `bottom` class creates a gradient background for the bottom section, which is likely intended to contrast with the top section.
6. **Container (`<div class="container">`):**
   - The `container` class gives the entire section a width of 100% and makes it cover the full viewport height. It is used to create a visually impactful section.
7. **Bottom Shoe (`<div class="bottom-shoe">`):**
   - The `bottom-shoe` class styles the container for shoe information and image. It sets a width, height, padding, and shadow.
   - Inside this container, the `info` class styles the text content with a maximum width, white text color, and spacing.
   - The shoe image is styled using the `shoe-image` class. It's positioned absolutely, has a circular border radius, and has a subtle hover effect to enlarge it.
