- Tags which are taught in the class are:
  1. Input Tag: The "input" tag is an HTML element used to create various types of form controls, allowing users to input data or make selections on a web page. It is a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't have a separate closing tag.
  2. Label Tag: The "label" tag in HTML is used to create a label or caption for form elements, such as input fields, select elements, radio buttons, checkboxes, and more. It associates the label's text with a specific form element, making the form more accessible and user-friendly.
  3. Select/Option Tag: "select" and "option" tags are used to create dropdown menus, also known as select lists, in forms. The "select" tag defines a dropdown list, and the "option" tag defines individual options within that list.
  4. TextArea Tag: "Textarea" tag is used to create a multi-line text input area in forms. Unlike single-line input fields created with the "input" tag, the "textarea" tag allows users to enter and edit multiple lines of text, making it suitable for longer text inputs, comments, or messages.
  5. FieldSet & Legend Tag: "fieldset" and "legend" elements are used together to create a grouped section within a form, providing a visual and semantic grouping for related form fields. The "fieldset" element allows you to group related form controls together, while the "legend" element provides a title or caption for the group.
  6. Text (type="text"): This input type is used for single-line text input. Users can enter any alphanumeric text, such as names, addresses, or short messages.
  7. Number (type="number"): This input type is specifically designed for numeric input. It provides a numeric keyboard on mobile devices and can restrict the input to numbers only.
  8. Button (type="button"): This input type represents a clickable button that can be used to trigger JavaScript functions or perform specific actions on the web page. It does not submit form data by default.
  9. Password (type="password"): This input type is used for password fields. The input characters are masked with asterisks or bullets, ensuring that the password is not visible to others while being entered.
  10. Email (type="email"): This input type is designed for email addresses. It can help ensure that the user enters a valid email format (e.g., "user@example.com") by utilizing browser validation.
  11. Radio (type="radio"): This input type creates radio buttons, which allow users to select a single option from a group of choices. Radio buttons within the same "name" attribute form a group, and users can only select one option from that group.
  12. checkbox: The checkbox input type is used for creating checkboxes. It allows users to select one or more options from a list of choices.
  13. image: The image input type is used to display an image that acts as a submit button. It allows users to submit a form by clicking the displayed image.
  14. date: The date input type is used for inputting dates in the format "yyyy-mm-dd." It provides a date picker on supporting browsers.
  15. datetime-local: The datetime-local input type is used for inputting both a date and time in the format "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm." It provides a combined date and time picker on supporting browsers.
  16. time: The time input type is used for inputting time values in the format "hh:mm." It provides a time picker on supporting browsers.
  17. reset: The reset input type is used to create a reset button within a form. When clicked, it resets all the form fields to their default values.
  18. submit: The submit input type is used to create a submit button within a form. When clicked, it submits the form data to the server for processing.
