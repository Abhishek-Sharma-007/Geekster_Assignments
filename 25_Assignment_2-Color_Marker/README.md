**Explanation:**

1. `<h1>CSS Color Markers</h1>`: A level one heading that displays the text "CSS Color Markers" and is centered due to the CSS style applied later.
2. `<div class="container">`: A container div that wraps the colored marker divs. It has a white background and padding to create some space between the markers.
3. `<div class="marker red">`: A div representing a red colored marker. It has two child divs: cap and sleeve.
4. `<div class="cap"></div>`: A div representing the cap of the marker. It will be colored differently based on the marker color.
5. `<div class="sleeve"></div>`: A div representing the sleeve of the marker. It will be colored differently based on the marker color.
6. `<div class="marker green">`: A div representing a green colored marker, similar to the red marker, with cap and sleeve divs.

**Explanation:**

1. `h1`: Applies styles to level one headings (h1). In this case, it centers the text using `text-align: center`.
2. `.container`: Applies styles to elements with class "container." It sets a white background and adds padding on the top and bottom (`10px`) and no padding on the left and right.
3. `.marker`: Applies styles to elements with class "marker." It sets a width of `200px`, a height of `25px`, and centers the element horizontally using `margin: 10px auto`.
4. `.cap`: Applies styles to elements with class "cap." It sets a width of `60px` and a height of `25px`.
5. `.sleeve`: Applies styles to elements with class "sleeve." It sets a width of `110px`, a height of `25px`, and a background color of `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`, which is a semi-transparent white color.
6. `.cap, .sleeve`: This rule groups both the "cap" and "sleeve" classes together and applies `display: inline-block` to make them appear side by side.
7. `.red`: Applies styles to elements with class "red," which is the red-colored marker. It sets a background gradient using `linear-gradient`, with three color stops from dark brown to light red. It also adds a box shadow with a reddish tint.
8. `.green`: Applies styles to elements with class "green," which is the green-colored marker. It sets a background gradient from dark green to light green and adds a box shadow with a green tint.
9. `.blue`: Applies styles to elements with class "blue," which is the blue-colored marker. It sets a background gradient from dark blue to light blue and adds a box shadow with a blue tint.

## CONCLUSION:
