# Major Project using Tailwind
---
## TASK 
- You need to complete **Major Project using Tailwind** task, and we have learned basic CSS Properties like:
1. **Utility-First Approach:** Tailwind follows a utility-first approach, which means that it provides a large set of utility classes that you can use to style your elements. This eliminates the need to write custom CSS for most of your UI elements, saving you a lot of time and effort.
2. **Responsive Design:** Tailwind makes it easy to create responsive designs by providing classes for various screen sizes. You can use classes like `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` to apply different styles based on the screen width. For example, `lg:text-xl` will increase the font size on large screens.
3. **Flexibility:** Tailwind is highly flexible and allows you to customize your styles by modifying the configuration file. You can add your own utility classes or tweak existing ones to match your project's design system.
4. **Rapid Prototyping:** Tailwind is excellent for rapid prototyping. You can quickly build and iterate on UI components by applying classes directly to HTML elements. This means you spend less time writing CSS and more time designing and refining your UI.
5. **Readability and Maintainability:** Tailwind classes are self-explanatory and provide a clear separation of concerns. This makes your HTML markup more readable and makes it easier for your team to maintain and collaborate on the codebase.
6. **Consistency:** Tailwind enforces consistency in your UI design because it encourages you to use a predefined set of classes. This consistency can lead to a more polished and professional-looking application.
7. Commonly used properties in Tailwind CSS:
   - **Text Color (`text-`):** Tailwind provides classes like `text-red-500` to set the text color. The number represents the shade of the color.
   - **Background Color (`bg-`):** Classes like `bg-blue-300` set the background color of an element.
   - **Padding (`p-`) and Margin (`m-`):** These classes control the spacing around elements. For example, `p-4` adds padding of 1rem (16px), and `m-2` adds a margin of 0.5rem (8px).
   - **Font Size (`text-`):** Use classes like `text-lg` to set the font size. The sizing is based on a predefined scale.
   - **Flexbox (`flex`, `justify-`, `items-`):** Tailwind includes classes for creating flexible layouts easily. `flex` sets an element to a flex container, `justify-center` centers items horizontally, and `items-center` centers items vertically within a container.
   - **Grid (`grid`, `grid-cols-`, `gap-`):** Tailwind provides classes for creating grid layouts. `grid` sets an element as a grid container, `grid-cols-3` divides the container into three columns, and `gap-4` adds a 1rem (16px) gap between grid items.
   - **Responsive Prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`):** These prefixes allow you to apply classes conditionally based on screen sizes. For example, `md:text-xl` will apply the `text-xl` class only on medium-sized screens and larger.
   - **Customization:** Tailwind allows you to customize the default configuration to add your own classes, modify existing ones, or define your color palette, making it adaptable to your project's needs.
