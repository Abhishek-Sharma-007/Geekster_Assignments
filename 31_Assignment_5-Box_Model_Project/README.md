# Assignment - 5 Box Model Project
---
## TASK 
- You need to complete "Box Model" task, and in this assignment we have learned basic CSS Properties like:
  - Background-Color: This property sets the background color of an element. It can take various values, such as color names, hexadecimal color codes, RGB values, etc. For example, background-color: #FF0000; would set the background color of an element to red.
  - Height / Width: Height sets the height of an element, while width sets the width. These properties can be set using different units like pixels (px), percentages (%), or other units like em or rem. For example, height: 200px; and width: 300px; would set the dimensions of an element to 200 pixels in height and 300 pixels in width.
  - Color: The color property sets the text color within an element. It also accepts color values like color names, hexadecimal codes, or RGB values. For example, color: #000000; would set the text color to black.
  - Text-Decoration: This property is used to add visual effects to text. Common values include:
    - none: No decoration (default).
    - underline: Adds an underline to the text.
    - overline: Adds a line above the text.
    - line-through: Adds a line through the text (strikethrough).
    - blink: Makes the text blink (not widely supported).
  - Margin / Padding:
    - Margin is the space outside an element's border, creating separation between elements. It can have values for top, right, bottom, and left margins, set in a clock-wise order (e.g., margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;).
    - Padding is the space between an element's content and its border. Like margin, it can have values for top, right, bottom, and left padding.
  - box-model:
    - The term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element.
    - It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
    - Box model also helps you to think how to design something in terms of boxes.

## EXPLANATION:
- The HTML structure defines a page with a title ("Rothko Painting") and includes an external CSS stylesheet (style.css). The body of the page contains a div with the class frame, which encloses another div with the class canvas. Within the .canvas div, there are three child div elements with classes .one, .two, and .three.
- In the CSS, .canvas sets the dimensions (width and height) of the canvas, sets its background color to a dark brown, applies an overflow of hidden to hide any content that exceeds the dimensions, and applies a blur filter to create a blurred effect.
- .frame styles the outer frame around the canvas. It adds a black border, sets its width, adds padding, and centers the frame using margin.
- .one and .two style the first and second inner divs within the canvas. They set dimensions, background colors, margins, box shadows for a raised effect, border radii for rounded corners, and apply rotation transforms for a subtle tilt effect. Both .one and .two are also blurred slightly using the filter property.
- .three styles the third inner div. It sets dimensions, background color, margin, blur filter, box shadow, border radius, and rotation transform for a distinct look.
