  1. Heading Tag: An HTML heading tag is used to define the headings of a page.
  2. div Tag: It is commonly used to create sections or divisions in a web page and acts as a container for other HTML elements, such as text, images, forms, or other nested elements.
  3. iframe: The <iframe> element stands for "inline frame" and is used to embed another HTML document or web page within the current document.It creates a window or a frame in which the content of the linked web page is displayed. The <iframe> element is commonly used to embed videos, maps, social media content, or external web pages directly into a web page.
  4. Paragraph Tag: It is used to group and define blocks of text. It is a block-level element, meaning it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available to it by default.
  5. BlockQuote Tag: This element is used to indicate a block of quoted content, such as a quote from another source or citation. It is also a block-level element, similar to the p element, so it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available to it by default. By default, browsers typically indent the blockquote content to visually distinguish it from regular text.
