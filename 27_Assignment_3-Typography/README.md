**EXPLANATION:**
   - The document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, indicating that it's an HTML5 document.
   - The `<html>` tag encloses the entire HTML content, and the `lang="en"` attribute specifies that the document is in English.
   - The `<head>` section contains metadata, such as the character encoding, compatibility settings, and viewport settings for responsive design.
   - The `<title>` tag sets the title of the web page, which appears on the browser's title bar or tab.
   - An external CSS file "style.css" is linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag.
   - The `<body>` section contains the visible content of the web page.
   - Inside the `<div>` element with the class "main," there are multiple sections wrapped in `<div>` elements with the class "data."
   - The content includes a heading (`<h2>`), an image (`<img>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and an embedded YouTube video (`<iframe>`).

**2. style.css file:**

**EXPLANATION:**
   - The ".main" class styles the main container with flexbox properties, making its child elements arrange in a column layout. It also sets the font-family to a series of fallback fonts, specifying that if one font is not available, the browser should try the next one in the list. It adds a bottom border with a dark color.
   - The ".data" class styles the individual sections with a width of 30% of the container's width, so they take up 30% of the available space.
   - The "h3" selector styles the heading level 2 (`<h2>`) with a color of "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)" (a slightly transparent black).
   - The "p" selector styles all paragraphs with a color of "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)" (a somewhat transparent black).
